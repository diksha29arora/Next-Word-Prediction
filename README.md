# Word-Prediction
This is a NLP and AI based project we can predict the next word given some previous words of a sentance.

I've first make the dataset from teh raw text file which is moby.txt. The dataset is made in such a way that first 25 words are going to be taken for features and next word(26th) is treated as label. Then I use tokenize funtion from keras to encode the text into word embeddings. Feel free to go through the ipynb file, try to run it on Google Colab because it's a very computationaly expensive task.

Happy Learning
