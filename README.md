# Next Word Prediction
Its is a Natural Language Processing based project which is capable of predicting the following word based on the previous words of a sentence.

In this project, the dataset has been taken from a raw text file, named "moby.txt". The dataset is structured in a way that first 25 words are taken for features and the 26th or the next word is treated as label. Then, a function called "tokenize" from keras is used to encode the text into word embeddings.
